## What is a Pressure Cooker

A pressure cooker is essentially a regular pot with a lockable semi-sealed lid equipped with a valve to control the pressure inside the pot.

### How It Works

The pressure cooker works by accumulating steam in the pot, increasing the pressure inside. As the pressure inside the pot increases, the boiling point of water also rises, allowing food with water content to be cooked at temperatures exceeding 100 â„ƒ.

### Advantages

* Due to the higher actual cooking temperature of the pressure cooker, cooking time can be significantly reduced.
* The high temperature inside the pressure cooker promotes browning and caramelization, creating a unique flavor.

## Process

* After placing ingredients and water into the inner pot, close the lid **ensuring the pot is sealed**, then heat.
* For tougher ingredients, such as tendons, using a pressure cooker can easily soften them, resulting in a better texture.
* Pressure cookers usually have a self-locking valve (float valve). During cooking, as the pressure inside the pot increases, the self-locking valve will activate and lock, isolating the gas inside and outside the pot, creating conditions for pressurization inside the pot. After the self-locking valve is activated, it will also lock the lid, preventing forced opening, thus ensuring safety. During cooking, it is necessary to ensure that the self-locking valve is not obstructed by foreign objects to allow the pressure cooker to function properly.
* Switch to the warm state, **empty the steam from the pot through the exhaust valve before opening the lid**.

### Precautions

* **Steam is very hot, do not approach the exhaust valve.**
* During the cooking process of **liquid foods**, **do not manually release the pressure** to avoid splashing (you can put the ingredients in a sealed jar or vacuum bag before cooking with a pressure cooker).
* Releasing pressure manually during the cooking of certain cuisines (such as soups) **may affect the taste and texture** of the food.
* Before opening the lid, make sure the steam has been released. When opening the lid, do not open it all at once, especially **do not open the lid facing a person directly** to avoid scalding from steam.
* After the pressure cooker has finished cooking, as the pressure inside the pressure cooker decreases to balance with the outside pressure, the self-locking valve will loosen. This can serve as a sign to judge whether the lid can be opened.
* The sealing of the pressure cooker depends on the sealing rubber ring in the lid. For old pressure cookers, it is necessary to check whether the sealing rubber ring is still effective.
* Ensure the rubber ring is completely clean, as any particles trapped in it may damage the airtight environment.
* Many pressure cookers have a safety line, and materials and liquids should not exceed this line. Too many ingredients and liquids may cause steam surges to block the exhaust valve or splash out too much steam, making it difficult to clean.
* For pressure cookers without a safety line, it is also best not to let the water level exceed two-thirds of the pot body.
* **Do not use pressure cookers to cook foods like oats or noodles that produce foam easily**. Foam may block the steam valve and pressure release pipe.
* During the cooking process, when the pressure valve rises and emits steam or smoke, it indicates that the pressure inside the pressure cooker is excessive. To ensure safety, the pressure valve releases excess pressure. Although the steam emitted has a strong aroma and brings higher pleasure, the flavor of the food is compromised, and excessive pressure may bend the slots of certain types of pressure cookers. Therefore, when steam is emitted, reduce the heat.

## Procedure
Pour water into the pot —— Ignite the fire and place the pot on the heat —— When the water boils (rolling boil with plenty of bubbles), add the ingredients.

### Notes
- Covering the pot can accelerate heating. However, this carries the risk of overflowing the pot. During prolonged heating, the fluid may boil excessively and spill out of the pot, resulting in overflow.
- If the pot is about to overflow, immediately reduce the heat and open the lid.
- To expedite heating while avoiding overflow, you can partially uncover the pot to allow gas to escape, or reduce the heat later on and monitor the pot's contents.
- Depending on the cooking requirements, ingredients can also be added to cold water. However, this method takes longer for the water to boil.

## Methods

### Steamer

- A steamer is a multi-layered structure, with the bottom layer used for holding water. It utilizes the heat generated by the steam produced when the water boils to heat the food on the upper layers.

-Add an appropriate amount of water to the bottom of the steamer —— Place the food in the upper steaming tray —— Place the steamer on the heat source

### Iron Pot (or other pot)

If you don't have a steamer, only a regular iron pot (not a flat-bottomed one), you can place a steamer trivet at the bottom of the pot and fill it with enough water to achieve a similar effect to a steamer.



## Tips

* Since the heat source is steam, the bottom of the food in the lower layers of the steamer may become wet from the water. To avoid this, you can place a steaming cloth under the food or create a simple support using chopsticks.
* You may want to  set timers to remind you to turn off the heat to prevent burning.
* When using a steamer to prepare food, pay attention to the remaining water in the bottom area, especially with an iron pot, to avoid dry pots and potential safety issues.
* (Optional) When steaming food in an iron pot, you can place a steaming plate on top of the trivet.

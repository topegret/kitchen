# Marinating

## Note

The marinating described here is a pre-cooking step for ingredients, not for making salted meat or cured sausages.

## Marinating

Marinating meat before cooking is a common method to infuse flavor into the meat. Generally, when marinate the raw meat, you can adjust the size of the meat cuts based on the dish's requirements.

The seasonings and condiments selected for marinating can be of any kind depending on the dish. Sometimes, additional processing of condiments may be necessary for different flavors.

## Basic Concepts of Marinating

The marinating process described here is for normal flavor.
Generally, 
- The larger the amount of meat, the more seasoning ingredients and condiments are needed.
- The longer the planned marinating time, the fewer seasoning ingredients and condiments are used.
- When marinating, the seasoning should be evenly distributed on all surfaces. If it's meat slices, use hands to mix and stir as evenly as possible. If it's a whole lamb leg, use hands or a brush to spread the seasoning evenly on the surface.
- The stir-frying meat or frying meat requires marinating in advance. To achieve a tender texture when stir-frying meat, it's important to use high heat and cook for a short period. Marinating beforehand can enhance flavor when cooking quickly.

## Marinating Techniques

- For thin shredded meat or thin slices: Due to the fragile texture, it should be handled gently. Use fingers to lightly mix the marinade, then gently stir in one direction.
- For shredded meat, slices, or chunks: Same technique as above, but with slightly more force.
- For chicken legs, chicken wings, etc.: Start by making several cuts on the ingredients' surface.Mix the marinade in a bowl first, then coat the ingredients evenly in the seasoning bowl.
- For lamb legs, etc.: Usually, holes can be pierced in the thicker parts of the meat. Then spread the mixed marinade evenly on the surface of the ingredients.

## Marinating Containers and Time

- Choose a container that can hold the ingredients and seasonings. This is called open marinating, with a relatively short marinating time, commonly seen as 0.5-2 hours. The lamb legs can also be marinated in this way, but for a longer time.
- You can choose large enough food-grade sealed bags for marinating too. This is call closed marinating, usually for a long time, such as overnight marinating or marinating ribs that are not easy to flavor. Commonly seen as 4 hours to overnight. Reduce the amount of seasoning slightly to avoid overly strong or salty taste in the finished dish.

## Common Marinating Ingredients

- Soy sauce: Provides a savory and slightly salty base flavor. Can be used for almost all meats.
- Dark soy sauce: Less salty but easy to color. Used for coloring and enhancing aroma. Should not be used in large quantities to avoid a bean-like taste. Can be used for almost all red meats (less commonly used), and more for pork liver.
- Salt: Adds saltiness without the soy sauce aroma after frying. Can be used for all meats.
- White (granulated) sugar: Adjusts sweetness (in large quantities) and can also tenderize the meat (in small quantities). Can be used for all poultry and livestock meats, but not commonly used for fish and seafood.
- Brown sugar: Adjusts sweetness and provides a unique flavor of brown sugar, slightly heavier than white sugar. Can be used for almost all meats (generally meats with darker color or deeper finished color).
- Oyster sauce: Adds savory, salty, and sweet flavors. Generally used for red meats.
- White vinegar/Rice vinegar: Adds sourness. Less commonly used.
- Aged vinegar/Balsamic vinegar: Adds both sourness and aroma. Suitable for dark-colored fish (especially grilled fish).
- Cooking wine: Removes fishy smell and enhances aroma. Can be used for almost all meats. However, attention should be paid to:
  - Cooking wine has a strong flavor, which can easily cover the aroma of the ingredients themselves. For ingredients with less fishy smell, cooking wine can be omitted to remove the smell. For example: beef, fish, and chicken.
  - For chicken, white wine can be used instead of cooking wine.
  - For beef, ginger and scallion water can be used instead of cooking wine.
  - For white fish, just clean the bloodlines and mucus, and there won't be any fishy smell. It is recommended not to add cooking wine.
- Yellow wine: Removes fishy smell and enhances aroma, with a better effect than cooking wine and a more complex aroma. Generally used for white meats. Can also be used for red meats, but the effect is similar to cooking wine.
- Five-spice powder/Thirteen-spice: Adds aroma to the meat, the simplest compound spice. Control the amount when using these spices for marinating. Can be used for almost all meats, but not commonly used for fish and seafood.
- Chili powder: Comes in many varieties. Besides adding spiciness, it can also add color to the dish. Avoid using too much chili powder for marinating dishes to prevent bitterness or excessive darkening of the color. Can be used for almost all meats that require a spicy base flavor, but cooking time should be slightly controlled to prevent the chili flavor from turning bitter or the color from becoming too dark.
- Cumin powder, fennel powder: Ground powders are generally used as marinades instead of granules, making it easier for the meat to absorb flavor. Can be used for almost all red meats and chicken.
- X pepper powder: Adds a spicy, pungent, fragrant taste to the meat. Use it in moderation to avoid overpowering other flavors.
  - Black pepper powder: Spicy and pungent. Can be used for almost all red meats.
  - White pepper powder: Spicy and fragrant. Slightly milder than black pepper, emphasizing aroma. Can be used for almost all meats.
  - Sichuan pepper powder: Spicy and pungent. It has the unique aroma of Sichuan pepper and is quite distinctive. Can be used for almost all meats.
- Fermented bean paste: Adds the bean aroma, saltiness, and spiciness to the meat. Can be used for almost all red meats.
- Scallion, ginger, garlic: Scallion and ginger remove fishy smell and add aroma; garlic adds pungency. Cut scallions into segments or slices as needed; ginger is generally sliced, and some scenes require peeling; garlic can be sliced or minced. If scallions and ginger are not desired in the finished dish, or if a lighter taste is needed, put the scallions and ginger pieces in a bowl with very little water and squeeze out the juice, then use the juice to marinate the meat. Garlic is generally not added directly. Can be used for all meats.
- Seafood sauce, shrimp sauce, etc.: Adds umami and saltiness to the meat. Seafood sauce is slightly sweet, while shrimp sauce is heavier in flavor. Can be used for almost all meats.
- Fermented black beans: Adds the fermented bean aroma and saltiness to the meat. Can be used for almost all red meats, but not commonly used.
- Cornstarch: Also known as raw starch. Cornstarch is an important marinating ingredient for battering. The thicker the batter or the smoother the texture desired, the more cornstarch is needed. It can be used for almost all meats. 

  - Cornstarch, potato starch: Generally have the highest viscosity.
  - Sweet potato starch: Slightly lower viscosity.
- Cooking oil: Adding a moderate amount of oil during marinating can seal in moisture and flavor. If using open containers for marinating, and for a long time (such as in a bowl), oil sealing can greatly ensure that the meat remains moist and not dry or tough. Can be used for almost all meats. After oil sealing, slightly reduce the amount of cooking oil for stir-frying, but there is no difference for deep-frying.

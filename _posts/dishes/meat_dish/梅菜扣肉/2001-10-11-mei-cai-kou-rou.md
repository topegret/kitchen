## Step-by-step Instructions


* Soak 50 grams of Meigan Cai (preserved mustard greens) in water for 1 hour.
* Pour 1 tablespoon of cooking oil into a pot and set it to high heat. Place the whole pork belly, skin side down, and cook in the pot for 3-4 minutes or until the skin caramelizes. Remove the pork belly from the pot and drain excess oil.
* Fill the pot with boiling water, add the pork belly, and boil over high heat for 20 minutes (test with chopsticks to ensure pork belly is cooked). Remove the pork belly.
* Evenly spread dark soy sauce, five-spice powder, and sugar on the surface of the pork belly, and let it sit for 15 minutes.
* Heat 1 tbsp cooking oil in a wok, add the pork belly, and fry over medium heat until both sides are golden brown (3-5 minutes). take out the meat.
* Use the left over oil in a wok, add the Meigan Cai, along with chopped millet pepper, minced garlic and salt. Stir-fry until the moisture from the  Meigan Cai is evaporated.
* Slice the pork belly (0.5-1 cm thick from the back end) and place it in a large bowl, then sprinkle the processed Meigan Cai on top.
* Steam the dish over medium-high heat for 45 minutes in your steamer.

* After completing the steaming process, allow it to cool down for about 20 minutes. Then, place a large plate upside down over the large bowl containing the pork belly, and flip the bowl to transfer the pork belly onto the plate.
* Serve [^2].

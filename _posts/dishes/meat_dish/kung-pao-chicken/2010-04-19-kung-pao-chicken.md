## Step-by-step Instructions

### Simple Version
- Tenderize the meat with the back of a knife, then cut into strips and then into 1.5cm square cubes. Soak in water for 10 minutes, then drain. 
- Place slieced ginger and  green part of the green onion in a bowl, pour in 1/4 cup of cold water, and set aside. Cut the white part of the green onion into 1.5cm round pieces. Roast peanuts in the microwave on high for 5 minutes, also set aside.
- In a bowl, mix chicken cubes with  salt, light soy sauce, cooking wine, and  corn starch, stir them until slightly dry. 
- Slowly add some of the ginger and green onion water, stirring until the chicken becomes sticky. Seal them with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for about 1 hour.
- Cut dried millet peppers into segments. Heat a pan over high heat, then reduce to low heat. Dry-fry the chili peppers until slightly charred, then set aside. Dry-fry the Sichuan peppercorns until fragrant, then set aside.
- Increase the heat, add vegetable oil to the pan, and when it's 70% hot (bubbles form around chopsticks), add the chicken cubes. Fry until the surface turns yellow-white, then flip and fry for another 30 seconds before stirring evenly.
- Add the chopped white part of the green onion and stir-fry.(if you have optional ingredients, add them in ) then add the remaining ginger and onion water. If needed, add more hot water. Cover and simmer over medium heat for 2 minutes.
- Increase the heat, add roasted peanuts, prepared dried millet peppers, and Sichuan peppercorns. Add Chinkiang vinegar and  sugar. Stir-fry until well combined.

- Turn off the heat, drizzle with 10g sesame oil, and serve.

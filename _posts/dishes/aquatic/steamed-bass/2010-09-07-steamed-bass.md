## Tips and Techniques

- The key to this dish lies in the timing and heat control. The size of the fish and the timing are correlated; overcooking will result in tough, unpleasant texture, while undercooking will leave some parts of the fish raw. Therefore, high heat steaming for around 8~ 10 minutes is generally optimal.
- Another important tip: do not immediately open the lid after turning off the steamer's heat. Let it sit for another 3 to 5 minutes. This allows for continued cooking!

- It's important to use chopsticks to separate the plate containing the fish when steaming. This has two benefits:

  1. During steaming, water droplets from the fish will drip onto the plate. Direct contact with the fish can cause it to become fishy when consumed.
  2. It ensures even heating of the fish

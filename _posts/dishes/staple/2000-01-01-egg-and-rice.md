## Quantitative Calculation

Prior to preparation, assess the quantity of servings you intend to create.Each serving size caters to 2 adult individuals.

### Serving Size
* cooked cold steamed rice - 3 cups
* Eggs - 2
* Ham - 1 cup (diced) 
* Cucumber - 0.5 ~ 1 cup（minced）
* Carrot - 0.5 ~ 1 cup（minced）
* Cooking Oil - 2 ~ 2.5 tsps
* Salt - 5g
* Black Paper Powder - 8g
* Sliced Green Oinon - 1 each
* Light Soy Source -2 tsps

Based on the above serving size and number of diners, calculate the proportion of ingredients used.

## Step-by-step Instructions

* Use a spatula to cut the cold rice into small pieces in advance
* Cut Ham, Carrots, Cucumbers into ~1/2 inch dices as needed
* Separate the egg whites and egg yolks into different bowls. Beat the egg yolks evenly in the bowl. Not to add salt at this step.
* Heat the wok over high heat until hot and dry.Add 2 tsps cooking oil to the hot wok. Once the oil reaches 150°F, add the egg whites.As the egg whites begin to coagulate, gently stir them to break them into small pieces.Remove the cooked egg whites from the wok and set them aside.
* If there is enough oil, add the egg yolk directly. If there is not enough oil, add additonal 0.5 tsp cooking oil and wait for it to heat up to high then add the egg yolks.
* After the main body of the yolk is solidified, reduce the heat to medium-low, pour in the ham sausage, carrots, cucumbers and other ingredients.(Optional: Adding frozen peas and corn will enhance both the color and flavor of the dish.)   
* stir-fry for 1 to 2 minutes (until them mixed evenly).
* Add the egg whites back and stir-fry for 30 seconds. Quickly add the rice and stir-fry over high heat .
* During the stir-frying process, mash the lumps of rice. This step may take a few minutes. Once all the rice is mashed, stir-fry evenly.
* Reduce heat to low, add salt, pepper and light soy sauce.
* Stir-fry further and evenly with high heat again. When you can see some rice "jumping" in the wok, it's almost done.
* Finally add the sliced green onion and stir-fry for another 20 seconds. 
* Turn off the heat and serve. 

## Additional Tips

- For optimal fried rice, using cold rice that has been refrigerated overnight is recommended. If you don't have cold rice available, freshly cooked rice can be used, but it should be cooled in the refrigerator immediately. However, to attain a distinct "clear-grained" texture, it's essential to fry it for a longer duration.

- To achieve separate grains in fried rice, it's crucial to fry the rice until dry. The reason behind the preference for cold, overnight rice is that it loses a certain amount of moisture overnight, aiding in the desired texture.

- Use [Indian Basmati rice](https://amzn.to/3UE9seU){:target="_blank"} for the best result.

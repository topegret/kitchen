There's this ancient Chinese saying, "工欲善其事，必先利其器" (gōng yù shàn qí shì, bì xiān lì qí qì)" which translates to "To do a good job, an artisan needs the best tools." This proverb emphasizes the importance of having the right equipment or resources when undertaking a task or endeavor. It suggests that in order to excel in any endeavor, whether it be work, art, or any other pursuit, it is essential to have the proper tools or resources at one's disposal. Only then can one truly achieve excellence and mastery in their craft. Cooking Chinese cuisine is no exception.

In addition to a traditional western kitchen setup, let's assume that you already have the following items in your kitchen. These items are not mentioned in the raw materials, tools, and recipes section.

> \* _If you have a gluten and soy sensitivity, [coconut aminos](https://amzn.to/3UBbJrx) is a great low-sodium alternative to soy sauce in Chinese cuisine. Made by fermenting coconut palm sap and sea salt, it has a milder and sweeter flavor than soy sauce, with significantly less sodium._  


### Herbs

In Chinese cooking, any dish featuring meat, fish, shrimp, eggs, or really any protein source, often benefits from the addition of these four essential herbs listed below.  Consider keeping them fresh in your kitchen for a more authentic touch.

- 大葱 (dà cōng) - chinese leek (you may want to use leek as the alternative)  
- 小葱 (xiǎo cōng) -green onion 
- 生姜 (shēng jiāng) - ginger
- 大蒜 (dà suàn) - garlic

## Cooking Oil

In Chinese cooking, cooking oil is chosen based on its intended use. There are three main categories: stir-fry oil, deep-fry oil, and cold salad oil.

### Stir-fry

In addition to soybean oil, avocado oil, and corn oil that are common in the American market, canola oil and [peanut oil](https://amzn.to/4bdQscQ){:target="_blank"} are commonly used in Chinese cooking. Of course, if you use [lard](https://amzn.to/3QgDlj6){:target="_blank"}  for cooking, the Chinese food will be quite authentic.

### Pan-fry and deep-fry
  
In Chinese cuisine, similar to Western cooking, pan-frying and deep-frying require oils with high smoke points to handle the intense heat. While coconut oil, palm oil, and butter may seem appealing due to lower trans fats, they are high in saturated fats, which can be detrimental to health in the long run.  

### Salad
  
This type of scenario does not require heating, so no trans fatty acids are produced. In Chinese salad dressings, [sesame oil](https://amzn.to/3WgykLd){:target="_blank"} reigns supreme. But when choosing sesame oil, opt for the roasted variety. Its rich, nutty aroma, aptly nicknamed "fragrant oil" in some parts of northern China, elevates your salads to a whole new level.

### Cooking oil reference  

|  | Saturated fatty acid (%) | Omega 3 (%) | Omega 6 (%) | Omega 9 (%) |
| :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: |
| canola oil | 7% | 11% | 21% | 61% |
| flaxseed oil | 9% | 57% | 16% | 18% |
| sunflower oil| 12% | 1% | 71% | 16% |
| corn oil | 13% | 1% | 57% | 29% |
| olive oil | 15% | 1% | 9% | 75% |
| soybean oil| 15% | 8% | 54% | 23% |
| peanut oil | 19% | 0% | 33% | 48% |
| lard | 43% | 1% | 9% | 47% |
| palm oil | 51% | 0% | 10% | 39% |
| butter | 68% | 1% | 3% | 28% |
| coconut oil | 91% | 0% | 2% | 7% |
| toasted sesame oil |14% | 0% | 41% | 40% |


Based on the above table, we can draw some conclusions:

* No oil is perfect and every oil has its pros and cons. Therefore, we should choose different oils according to different cooking scenarios.
* The same type of oil should not be used all the time. Different oils should be selected according to different cooking scenarios to ensure nutritional balance.
* In order not to consume too much `trans fatty acids`. When heating, do not choose thermally unstable oil and do not heat it for too long.
* Do not eat large amounts of fried food. Oils with good thermal stability often contain a large amount of saturated fatty acids and are not suitable for long-term consumption.
* Do not reuse oil. During the heating process, oil will produce a large amount of trans fatty acids.
